# Irreducible Polynomials and Their Shifts In Galois LFSRs

## Motivation
When a Galois model LFSR is loaded with an irreducible polynomial it will produce from each register a sequence which belongs to a certain set of classes. Here I investigate these classes some.

## Extension
Now that it has become obvious that to proceed some standard naming convention is needed to reference each of the classes the code was extended to introduce the similar conventions appearing Udar & Kagaris 2007.

## Follow Up
With these classes now having each a reference point the focus can be shifted towards the sequences. Determining the sequences produced by each register and the classes these sequences fall into will allow the polynomial to be checked for validity in the future interleaving within a Galois LFSR to produce an m-sequence.
